= Location

== Introduction

Location is a plugin that will allow you to create relatively robust list of locations (stores, churches, etc.). This uses the Directory extension by Loren Johnson as a starting point but makes a number of different decisions. First it uses Geokit (http://geokit.rubyforge.org) to handle the heavy lifting. Second, the JavaScript is completely rewritten to use version 2 of the Google Maps API and to make some additional API changes (this is still TODO)

== Geokit Modifications

I've made a few modifications to GeoKit to get it to work inside the extension and to maintain certain Radiant paradigms. 

* Geokit is included as a library to the extension rather than as a plugin
* All references to the configuration values have been changed to use Radiant::Config
